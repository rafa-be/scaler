"""Abstracts the connection between the user-facing ``Client`` and the background
``ClientAgent`` so that different execution environments can share the same
``Client`` code.

On native CPython, the ``Client`` runs in the user's thread and the
``ClientAgent`` runs its asyncio loop in a background thread. The two
communicate over an "internal" IPC socket pair (``ipc://`` or ``tcp://`` on
Windows) so the ``Client`` can submit tasks synchronously while the agent
handles network I/O and manager state on its own loop.

Browser / Pyodide environments cannot start threads and cannot create IPC
sockets, but they can run the same ``ClientAgent`` logic directly on the single
available asyncio loop (via JSPI's ``pyodide.ffi.run_sync`` to keep the
``Client``'s sync API). This module defines the interface both paths must
satisfy, and implements both the native (``IPCAgentBridge``) and browser
(``InProcessAgentBridge``) paths.

# Browser-side heartbeat to the scheduler.
#
# Background. In the browser, the agent's heartbeat coroutine shares the
# single asyncio loop with the user's notebook code. Long synchronous pure-
# Python work (cloudpickle of large constants, pargraph graph construction,
# numpy result hand-off) blocks the loop entirely, the heartbeat task never
# runs, and the scheduler's ``client_timeout_seconds`` (default 60s) trips
# and disconnects the client mid-computation.
#
# A previous attempt drove the heartbeat from ``sys.setprofile``. That works
# for pure-Python heavy code (e.g. cloudpickle has many call/return events),
# but breaks down when the wasm stack is JSPI-suspended inside a single
# ``run_sync`` call (e.g. the Client's initial scheduler handshake waiting
# on ``get_object_storage_address``): the user's Python stack has no frames
# executing while suspended, so the profile callback never fires.
#
# This implementation uses a JavaScript ``setInterval`` instead. The timer
# fires from the browser's event loop, which runs even while wasm is
# JSPI-suspended. The timer callback is pure JS (a closure that captures
# the WebSocket and a pre-built ``Uint8Array``) so it never re-enters wasm
# or Python -- it just calls ``ws.send(buf)``. The buf contains a YMQ-framed
# ``ClientHeartbeat`` capnp message with zeros for cpu/rss/latency: the
# scheduler only cares about the arrival, not the contents.
#
# The timer is installed via a class-level ``post_open_hook`` on
# ``ConnectorSocket`` that fires when the WebSocket completes its YMQ
# handshake. The hook is set in ``InProcessAgentBridge.start()`` and
# filters by socket-instance identity so only the agent's scheduler
# connector gets a heartbeat timer (not the object-storage connector or
# any other ConnectorSockets the user may create).
