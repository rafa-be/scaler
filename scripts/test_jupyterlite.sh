# test_jupyterlite.sh -- manual JupyterLite + wasm client debug harness.
#
# Starts a full Scaler cluster (object storage, scheduler on ws://, monitor,
# one worker) plus the docs HTTP server that serves the JupyterLite site and
# the wasm wheel.
#
# The scheduler binds to a ws:// address.  Both native CPython workers and the
# browser wasm client speak the same YMQ-over-WebSocket protocol, so a single
# bind address covers both.
#
# After this script exits you can open the URL printed below in a browser,
# navigate to send_heavy_object.ipynb (the lightweight smoke test) or any of
# the gallery notebooks, and run cells one-by-one to exercise the wasm client.
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - .venv is set up (uv pip install -e ".[all]" and dev deps: uv sync --group dev)
#   - wasm wheel has been built and deployed:
#       ./scripts/build_wasm.sh
#   - docs have been built:  cd docs && make html
#   - tmux is installed

set -euo pipefail

# Resolve repo root from the script location so this works regardless of
# the user's CWD or where the repo is checked out (devcontainer or host).

# drop SwapCVA/XVA clients before they finished. Workers get the same headroom
# so a long Monte Carlo task on a single worker is not killed mid-computation.
