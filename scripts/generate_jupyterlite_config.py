"""Regenerate ``docs/source/jupyter_lite_config.json`` from the wheels in
``docs/source/_static/wasm/``.

Run from the workspace root:

    python scripts/generate_jupyterlite_config.py

jupyterlite-sphinx feeds this config to ``jupyter lite build`` during
``make html``. ``PipliteAddon.piplite_urls`` makes the listed wheels available
to ``piplite.install(...)`` from the in-browser kernel without any network
fetch -- the gallery notebooks rely on this so the only setup the user has to
do is edit the ``SCHEDULER_ADDRESS`` cell.

Paths in the config are relative to ``docs/source/`` (the directory containing
``conf.py`` and ``jupyter_lite_config.json``).
