"""Regression tests for the worker's top-level lifecycle handling (``Worker._run``).

The ``jne-fix-ymq`` failure: a worker's internal YMQ binder is shut down (``disconnect``/teardown)
while a ``binder.send`` driven by one of the worker's loops is still in flight. The send surfaces
``SocketStopRequested`` (see ``tests/io/test_ymq_async_binder.py``), which propagates through
``asyncio.gather`` into ``Worker._run``. Before the fix the handler logged it as a "failed
with unhandled exception" crash; it must instead be treated like ``ConnectorSocketClosedByRemoteEnd``
- an expected teardown condition that is logged, never surfaced as a crash, and does not produce a
nonzero exit code.
