"""io-layer contract tests for ``YMQAsyncBinder``.

A ``detached=True`` send is fire-and-forget: it schedules the send and returns, so a peer that never
connects cannot block the caller, and a failure is logged rather than raised at a caller that has
already moved on. Callers that need the send to have left the process pass ``detached=False``, and
they still get the ``SocketStopRequested`` fail-fast the worker boundary handles -- the graceful
shutdown path is the one that relies on it. See ``tests/worker/test_worker.py`` for that boundary.
