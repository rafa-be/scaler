"""Subject process for ``tests/io/test_ymq_interpreter_shutdown.py``.

Each scenario leaves a ymq socket alive in a module global and returns. The socket is therefore still
alive when the interpreter starts finalizing, which is the situation that used to dead-lock (see
finos/opengris-scaler#945). Run as ``python -m tests.io.interpreter_shutdown_subject <scenario>``;
the test asserts the process exits cleanly rather than aborting or hanging.

This is not a test module itself, and is named so that test discovery skips it.
